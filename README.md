### desktop pin

kwin script for making windows inside/outside a specified area pin to all desktops

i pretty much just use this to make the desktops act like gnome, where only the primary monitor switches

`make install`: install the plugin

`make uninstall`: uninstall the plugin

`make debug`: replace kwin with debug logging enabled and tail the log (you need to re-run kwin --replace from krunner after using this)
